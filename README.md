# foo_subsonic

**This is highly experimental code.**

*This code is far away from being "ready to use".*

Only a few things are tested, and receiving the complete album list of subsonic is currently disabled.
I'm not a C++ programmer and just playing around here, so please be careful.

## Requirements:
	* TinyXML
	* Foobar2000 SDK
	* MS Visual Studio (at least version 2010, I use 2015 Community Edition)
